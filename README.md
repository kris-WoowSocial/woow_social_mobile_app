   cd woow_social_mobile_app
   ```

2. **Setup Environment Variables**

     ```
   - Fill in the required API keys and secrets in the `.env` file

## üîí Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Secrets
- All sensitive information must be stored in the `.env` file
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed
- Use the `Environment` class to access environment variables

### Google Services Configuration
- `google-services.json` is used for Firebase configuration
- This file contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control
- The file is already in `.gitignore`

### Secure Storage
- Use `SharedPreferences` only for non-sensitive data
- For sensitive data, consider using `flutter_secure_storage`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Style
- Follow the official [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)
- Run `flutter format .` to format your code
- Use meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

### Dependencies
- Manage dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
- Run `flutter pub upgrade` to update dependencies
- Document any major dependency changes in pull requests
